## 🎯 About

Describe your project

## ✨ Features

✔️ **Two-Player Game:** The application supports two players, and they can each input their names. Players alternate turns for fair gameplay.

✔️ **Board Visualization:** The game board is clearly represented in the terminal with cell numbers from 1-9 for each possible move. As the game progresses, the board updates to show the current state.

✔️ **Interactive User Input:** The game asks for player moves interactively and provides feedback on invalid inputs. Players select their moves by entering the cell number where they want to place their marker.

✔️ **Win Detection:** The game can detect win conditions (three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal) and declare the winner, if one exists.

✔️ **Game Loop:** The game loop handles the turns between players, continually checks the game state, and ends the game when a win condition or a tie is reached.

✔️ **Score Keeping:** The application keeps track of the number of games won by each player. The score is displayed at the end of each game.

✔️ **Colorful Text Output:** Utilizing colored and styled text output for a more visually appealing and readable user interface.

✔️ **Rematch Feature:** After a game concludes, players have the option to play again without needing to restart the program.

✔️ **Clean and Modular Design:** The codebase is cleanly designed and separated into distinct classes (Player, Board, Game), each with their own responsibilities, for easy understanding and maintainability.
